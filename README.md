### HOW TO PLAY LOCALLY
- Copy `example.env` as `.env`
- In command line, go to project root folder and run `pipenv run flask run`
- Open the url in browser
- Enjoy!

Note:
- An internet connection is needed to load some JS files for running the timer, but you can still play without the timer.
- A `Procfile` is included for easy deployment to Heroku
